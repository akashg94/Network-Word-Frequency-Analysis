1. Access the attached dataset in your lab or download for local use here:

2. Write a Python code to extract keyword data from the above file and convert it to a weighted adjacency matrix. See the figure below to understand the process
3. Read the adjacency matrix and convert it into a weighted network

4. Compute node degree and strength

5. Show the top 10 nodes by degree and top 10 nodes by strength

6. Show the top 10 node pairs by weight

7. Plot average strength on y-axis and degree on x-axis
